Introduction
This group assignment is designed to help you apply and expand your IoT knowledge gained throughout the semester during tutorials and the individual practical assignment by collaboratively building an IoT project in a group. In addition, it aims to strengthen your skills in project management and effective teamwork.

The group project can either be based on a new idea or involve expanding and scaling up an individual practical project from one of the team members. Through this assignment, you will demonstrate your practical skills in areas such as:

Sensors and actuators
IoT communication
Edge devices
APIs
Data collection, storage and analysis
Cloud computing
IoT programming
You can discuss the project idea with your tutor and obtain approval before starting the different phases of your project.

Important to note
This is a group assignment (3 or 4 students per group).
You can team up with any other students in your tutorial. If you don't have a group, you can email or discuss with your tutor and they can help you team-up with other students.
This group assignment is worth 30% of the total marks of the unit.
The evaluation consists of two parts:
Design, Implementation, and demonstration of your work to the tutors (85 pts)
Report and peer review form (15 pts)
The demonstration is due on week 12. The Online Submission (report and source code) is due June 5 (23:59) via Canvas.
All members of the group must be present for the demonstration in week 12 during your usual tutorial. 
Please read the instructions provided below on submission requirements, late submission, and plagiarism policy.
 

Part 1: Design, Implementation and Demonstration (85 points)
The group must design, implement, and demonstrate an IoT project to the tutors at their week 12 tutorial session. All the team members must be present for the demonstration.

Stages
 

You can break down your group assignment into the following stages:

Stage 1: Conceptualise an IoT project.
Define a scenario, problem, or idea that your IoT project will address. The group must agree on a clear and well-defined concept for the project. Tutors are available to provide guidance during this stage.

Stage 2: Identify the components of the IoT system.
Break the project into distinct components, assigning each group member responsibility for a different part of the system. The final project must function as an integrated whole and will be assessed as a single system.

Stage 3: Develop the sensing/actuation system (15 pts).
Select suitable sensors and actuators, and implement the required code using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Your edge devices must support bidirectional communication to allow for remote monitoring and control.

Stage 4: Use of IoT communication protocols at edge and cloud layers (15 pts).
Ensure that your system components—including edge devices and cloud services—communicate using a lightweight IoT protocol such as MQTT or CoAP.

Stage 5: Develop rules for system behavior (15 pts).
Create logic that analyzes data from various inputs (e.g., sensors, user interfaces, public APIs) to control the behavior of your IoT system. Projects that incorporate rules triggered by multiple data sources (e.g., both a sensor and an internet-based value) will receive higher marks.

Stage 6: Integrate an external API (20 pts).
Use an existing RESTful API (e.g., Google, Twitter, Telegram, Instagram, Discord) to enhance the functionality of your system. This API should allow interaction with your IoT devices.

Stage 7: Use a cloud computing platform (20 pts).
Use an IoT cloud platform for device management, data collection, processing, and/or visualization. Your project should clearly demonstrate the benefits of cloud integration.
